# Ortholog notes


## Entrez Gene Orthologs

From NCBI Help Desk:

    Thank you for your interest. HomoloGene is no longer being updated.

    For specific vertebrate genes:

    you may identify orthologs in other vertebrates through the orthologs from the annotation pipeline links found in the Gene database records. See for example, the human MLH1 gene (GeneID: 4292). In the Summary section of the record, use the link to all orthologs.
    Alternatively, you can search the Gene database with this search term:
    ortholog_gene_nnnn[group]
    Where "nnnn" is the human Gene ID.
    Additionally, there is a file (gene_group.gz) on the Gene FTP site that has all the relationships.
